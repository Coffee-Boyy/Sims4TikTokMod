As a temporary solution, copy the sims4communitylib source files into this folder to gain access to the S4CL python imports: https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary/tree/master/Scripts/sims4communitylib

You should end up with a folder path that looks like this: ScriptLibrary\S4CL\README.md
