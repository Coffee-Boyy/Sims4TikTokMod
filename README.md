## S4CL Sample Mod
This is a basic mod utilizing the Sims 4 Community Library by ColonolNutty: https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary

If installed into your Mods folder, it will display a notification upon loading a household.

This project may be used as a template for which you may create your own mods (If you have any questions, feel free to join the [discord](https://discord.gg/p9Kc287) and ask them there!)

The Setup Steps have moved to the wiki, [check them out](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/s4cl-template-project/wiki/Project-Setup)!
