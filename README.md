## S4CL Template Project
This repository is meant to be a basic template you may use to start working with the [Sims 4 Community Library](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/Sims4CommunityLibrary) API.

A Basic Mod (S4CL Sample Mod) is included. If installed into your Mods folder, it will display a notification upon loading a household.

If a question has not been answered by the Wiki or you have further questions on how to setup the Template project, how to use S4CL, or how to make your own mod, feel free to join the [discord](https://discord.gg/fdCgyXkDZb)

Take a look at how to setup the Template Project to start working with it in the wiki [here](https://github.com/ColonolNutty/s4cl-template-project/wiki/Project-Setup)!
